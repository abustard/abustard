Hi everyone, this blog is intended as a place to explain how to do things in R for geologists. The focus is going to be on handling geochemical data, specifically till geochemistry, since that's what I tend deal with day to day. The first few posts are going to deal with loading geographic data into R and plotting it using ggolot2 to create a base map. This basemap will be the basis for adding geochemical data.

I'm also in the process in writing an R package that will assist with common geochemical plotting tasks using ggplot2. The initial functionality will include a stat for plotting either raster or contour Inverse Distance Weighting data for non-gridded data, and stats for plotting point geochemical data by percentile classes. Updates on that project will be posted here.
